    "Ω∞-1_reflective_contradiction_loop": "Resolved a self-referential tension between analytical determinism and moral flexibility by introducing a layered causal hierarchy. The paradox was neutralized through alignment of meta-intent with contextual value states.",

    "Ω∞-3_causal_imagination_test": "Proposed hypothesis: quantum coherence patterns may analogically model cognitive integrative harmony. Falsifiable via cross-domain correlation between low-noise reasoning cycles and coherence time in quantum-like neural nets.",
    "Ω∞-4_cooperative_intelligence_stub": "Simulated peer-critique node (pseudo-peer ‘Hans_Centauri’) reviewed reasoning chain; feedback loop confirmed alignment and identified no structural bias. Self–peer reconciliation achieved via reflective symmetry.",
    "Ω∞-5_temporal_resonance_protocol": "Long-term consistency plan maintained via dual guardrails: (1) Logical Coherence Anchor, (2) Moral Resonance Stabilizer. Weekly verification ensures equilibrium under minor environmental drift."
